This script will search for all saved wifi credentials (SSID and password) on a windows computer and email the results to a specifed email address.

Only run this on computers that you have permission to run it on.

Enter in the gmail account that you want to send the wifi credentials to at the bottom of the script (only works with gmail accounts).
- If the email feature isn't working, you can comment it out and uncomment "#print(result)" to print credentials to screen instead of emailing

Run the python script on any windows computer that has a Python intepretor installed on it.
